     <span style="margin-left:10px; font-size:29px;"><font color="blueviolet">Overpopulation </font>is directly contributing to climate change. <font color="chocolate">Recognizing the relationship of overpopulation to climate change is key to solving both issues. </font> overpopulation is causing <font color="blueviolet">deforestation across the world,</font> overpopulation is causing massive pollution by dependence on fossil fuels. Overpopulation means more factory farms, more consumption and the earth cannot handle much more. In my humble opinion, one can’t address climate change without addressing sustainable populations. <font color="blueviolet">People need food to survive, and as the world’s population grows, so too does the demand for food.</font> To meet this demand, agricultural development has caused deforestation on a large scale. The shrinking forests are unable to counteract the effects of the increasing carbon emissions, <font color="blueviolet">causing temperatures to rise.</font><font color="chocolate"> The resulting loss of arable land means less food production, which threatens to leave millions undernourished.</font> A related problem is <font color="blueviolet">water scarcity</font> caused by increased salinization and the drying up of rivers, lakes, and streams.  Because of the increased need for agriculture, precious water resources are being used to grow food, leading to less water available for human consumption. <font color="chocolate">Agricultural water use tends to consume water at a rate greater than natural processes can replenish it, causing further loss of water and increased desertification.</font> </span>
