  <h1 id="infrastructure">Climate Change Impact on Infrastructure</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p id="ipara">physical infrastructure includes bridges, roads, ports, electrical grids and other parts of our
    transportation and communication systems.most communities have infrastructure that was designed without climate
    change in mind.<br><br>existing infrastructure may not be able to withstand extreme weather events that bring heavy
    rain, floods, wind, snow or temperature changes.impacts that results from these events occur in many different ways.
    for example:increased temperatures require more <font color="chocolate">indoor cooling, which can put stress on an
      energy grid</font>.sudden heavy rainfall that exceeds storm water drainage capacity can lead to flooding that
    shuts down<font color="chocolate"> highways, major transportation routes and businesses</font>. sea level rise can
    also lead to <font color="crimson">coastal erosion and high-tide flooding.</font><br><br>
    <font color="blue"><i>resilience education</i></font> is important for every role of our society,includes city
    planners, emergency managers, educators, risk communiocators.everyone can learn how to prepare for climate change
    through resiliency education.
